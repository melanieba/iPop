This project is a music database we created with some of our favorite songs, inspired by the functionalities of apps like Spotify, Pandora, etc. The purpose of this assignment was to show our understanding of relational databases, coding our database in MySQL, PHP to connect to our school server, and HTML to display our database on a website.

Note: We did not provide the link to the website because it is connected to our school server and is not accessible to anyone outside of our school.
